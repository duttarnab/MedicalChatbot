  utter_cough_question:
  - text: "**Cause:** Cough, like persistent pain, is not a disease in itself but a symptom of an underlying condition. It is the sound of air passing through the throat when it exits through the windpipe. Coughing is the body's way of trying to expel mucus, or other obstructions in the throat, vocal cords, or airways. There are several types of coughs. A cough that produces mucus is called a wet cough, while a cough without mucus is called a dry cough. If a cough persists, and you experience chest pain while coughing and it lasts for more than a week, it could be a sign of asthma. Coughing can also be caused by natural weakness. There is a type of cough that occurs due to a person's mental vulnerability, leading to coughing without any apparent reason. There are two more types of coughs - a new cough and an old cough.  \n **Treatment for New Cough:**  \n In the case of a new cough, first fast for 2 days or consume warm water enema until constipation is relieved. Then, for two to three days, consume a fruit-only diet or boiled vegetables. When you have a fever along with a cough, apply a wet mud pack on the chest overnight. However, when there is no fever, apply a wet cloth pack on the back. Mix lemon juice in a generous amount of water. With these treatments, a new cough will surely improve. Drinking six doses of lukewarm water from a yellow bottle exposed to the sun for half an hour each day also helps to alleviate a new cough. Treatment for Old Cough: In the case of an old cough, fast for three days, then eat fruits for ten days and use an enema until constipation is relieved. Then, stick to a diet of bread and vegetables. Wet the chest and shoulders with a wet cloth for one and a half hours in the morning and do abdominal bathing for ten minutes. Wet a cloth and wrap it around the head, covering the nose with the mouth closed, inhale vapor from the nostrils and then dry the whole body with a towel. After repeatedly warming and cooling the chest at night, wrap a wet cloth on the chest and shoulders for an hour. Drink lemon juice in abundance, practice deep breathing, take walks in clean air in the morning and evening, have a simple and easily digestible diet, and practice dry friction baths before and after a bath.  \n**Additional Tips:**  \n Extract garlic juice and filter it through cotton. Mix two tablespoons of pure honey with two tablespoons of onion juice and consume it. This remedy is highly effective in this condition. Drinking half a measure of sun-exposed, orange-colored bottle water in the morning and the same quantity of deep blue bottle water daily can quickly cure old dry cough."

  utter_jaundice_question:
  - text: "In this disease, the color of urine turns yellow. Subsequently, the eyes, nails, and skin also turn yellow gradually. Not only that, as the disease progresses, the patient perceives everything in a yellowish hue. In addition to these, in this disease, symptoms such as indigestion, itching, fever, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and irritability become apparent. The taste in the mouth becomes bitter, and there is an aversion to sweets and fats. Jaundice is different from yellow fever. Yellow fever is not infectious like yellow fever, and it does not cause very high fever (106 or 107 degrees). A few days before the onset of jaundice, the patient experiences some bitterness in their nature. They cannot sleep well, and they develop an aversion to food. Their stomach begins to feel upset, to the point that within 24 hours of the onset, whatever the patient eats or drinks is regurgitated. Sometimes, there is also a mild pain in the lower right shoulder of the patient before the onset of the disease. Before the onset of the disease, the patient may feel a little chill and becomes restless. Jaundice is known as `Kamala` in Ayurveda, and it is different from `Kamala` in English. The main cause of this disease is a disorder of the liver, meaning when there is some malfunction in the functioning of the liver, the bile it produces starts accumulating in the blood instead of passing into the small intestine through the bile duct. This accumulation of bile in the blood causes the patient's skin, eyes, and urine to turn yellow. The level of bilirubin in the liver and bile ducts increases. Due to an excess of protein, sugar, and fatty substances in the diet, the liver's workload increases, making the patient weak and inefficient. In children, a liver disorder due to feeding food before the right time, especially the consumption of white sugar and sweets, can lead to jaundice. Other causes of jaundice may include blockage of the bile duct or gallbladder, overeating, lack of exercise, and snakebites, dog bites, jackal bites, and bites from poisonous snakes. The consumption of mercury or lead, as well as poisonous substances and drugs, can lead to blockages in the bile ducts and the formation of stones or abscesses in the gallbladder. Malaria, typhoid, and other diseases can also lead to jaundice. Mental stress, fear, and other mental disturbances can also be a reason for jaundice, among others.  \n **Treatment:**  \n Until the disease is severe or according to the patient's condition, fasting for two to seven days while drinking warm water is recommended. If this is not possible, then depending on the form of the disease, staying on fruit juices for 10 to 14 days is essential. In both cases, enemas are necessary daily. After fasting or a liquid diet on fruits for 7 to 10 days, gradually introduce vegetables and bread. Take a sponge bath with lukewarm"

  utter_malaria_question:
  - text: "Malaria fever is known as intermittent or irregular fever. It can also be referred to as seasonal fever or fever associated with mosquito bites, cold fever, monsoon fever, agricultural fever, etc. The notion that malaria is solely caused by mosquitoes is a misconception. It is important to note that during the same season when malaria is prevalent, there is also a higher population of mosquitoes. Therefore, both malaria and mosquitoes are attributed to an unhealthy environment. This type of fever occurs primarily during seasonal transitions and occasionally at other times. The timing, intensity, onset, and subsidence of this fever are unpredictable. This variability is why Ayurveda refers to this fever as irregular or intermittent fever. Before and sometimes after the onset of this fever, the body feels weak. Muscle and joint pain, fatigue, eye watering, a preference for sunlight, discomfort in the shade, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and back pain may occur. Patients become restless, their extremities become cold, and they sometimes experience chills and shivering. When the fever is about to spike, patients often break into a sweat. The high fever (105 degrees or more) causes dryness in the mouth, rapid breathing, and intense thirst. Patients may lose consciousness or become extremely lethargic. After some time, sweating profusely, the fever subsides, leaving the patient very weak. In fact, after experiencing 6-7 bouts of fever, the patient may become so weak that they may not recover their strength. The skin takes on a yellowish tint, and the spleen and liver become enlarged due to the increased effort to purify the blood. The abdomen becomes distended, with blue veins visible. The arms and legs become thin, and there is swelling of the face with loss of appetite. Malaria fever recurs every day, or there may be variations in the fever pattern. This is why it is referred to as intermittent malarial fever. Sometimes, when the fever doesn't fully go away and subsides for a while before rising again, it is called remittent malarial fever. There is also a severe form of malaria called malignant malaria, commonly found in countries with a high incidence of malaria, such as Bangladesh. Some individuals may experience a form of malaria where the fever occurs without chills or the warming of hands and feet.  \n **Causes:**  \n The onset of malaria fever is linked to stomach problems and uncleanliness resulting from irregular eating and living habits. The mosquito's poison can only have an effect when it comes into contact with the accumulated impurities in the body. If the stomach is clear and the blood is clean, mosquito poison cannot harm us. Malaria usually strikes where people breathe in the air laden with foul gases emanating from the earth after rainfall, and this air pollutes the blood, causing digestive system disorders. This is why malaria epidemics are especially prevalent at the end of the rainy season, typically in September-October when the earth is damp, and the environment is cooler.  \n **Treatment:*  \n When the symptoms of malaria fever become apparent, the patient should stop eating and take warm foot baths or steam baths. During the onset of the fever, patients should take lime juice with hot water or fast for a few hours daily. After a few days, switch to lime juice with cold water. If constipation is a problem, first take a lime juice enema for a couple of days to clear the bowels. Then continue with lime juice in cold water. If the stools are not clear, a lukewarm water enema should be administered every three days. After this, administer an enema only once every few days. When the fever subsides or is about to subside, the patient should gradually return to a normal diet. On the day when the fever is completely gone, one should consume lemon juice mixed with water or the `soup` of green leafy vegetables. Then gradually reintroduce regular food. It is important to maintain a regulated and not hurried approach to eating and drinking. On days when the fever is entirely absent, it is advisable to consume lemon juice mixed with water or the `soup` of green leafy vegetables in place of regular meals. Then reintroduce regular food and milk. Patients with liver and spleen enlargement should undergo fasting, enemas, and wet cloth applications to cleanse the body and also apply wet, warm compresses to the affected area. For individuals with liver and spleen enlargement, warm cloth applications should be given on the feet, belly, or both. Lime juice enemas, wet, warm cloth applications, and sunbathing are also helpful. On fasting days, consuming two crushed garlic cloves or roasted alum with ghee (clarified butter) before breakfast can help prevent malaria. Additionally, taking 7 to 10 crushed basil leaves, warmed and mixed with water, helps in the management of malaria. Patients should be given at least one full-body sponge bath in 12 hours, during which the entire body should be gently massaged with a wet sponge. For overnight treatment, wrap the wet sponge in a thick, warm blanket and place it under the back, belly, and both legs. Change this application each time the fever drops to 102 degrees. If the fever rises above 103 degrees, a cold compress should also be applied to the forehead. Rest is advised, and it is crucial to have proper sleep. Every 12 hours, the whole body should be thoroughly cleansed using a wet sponge bath. At night, when you sleep, a warm, wet cloth should be applied to the abdomen. In the early morning hours, give the patient a sunbath with mildly heated sesame oil on the heart. Afterward, give a mehndi (henna) bath or a belt bath for 20 minutes. A mehndi bath or belt bath should be repeated after four to five hours. On alternate days, a sunbath is also recommended. Take a sunbath or give a belt bath 15 minutes before the cold weather arrives. It is advisable to put wet, warm compresses on the feet for 15 minutes, followed by sunbathing or a warm foot bath 15 minutes before the cold season begins. In case of liver and spleen enlargement, fasting, enemas, and wet cloth applications are recommended. For fever patients, wet, warm sponge baths and cloth applications are essential for at least 15 minutes in the morning and before bedtime. On fever-free days, consume lemon juice mixed with water in place of regular meals. Later, fruits and milk should be reintroduced. Increase your consumption of regular meals gradually. Sleep with a wet sponge on the belly at night. Taking a glass of warm, deep blue water from a copper vessel three times a day is beneficial for malaria patients. However, if constipation is present, it is advisable to clear the bowels with warm water from a copper vessel a couple of days before starting the treatment. Following that, you should consume the warm blue water from the copper vessel. Garlic with ghee or roasted alum (2-3 ratti) in any form is beneficial for the patient when he has malaria. If the fever recurs on the day when the fasting is not prescribed, lemon juice mixed with water or the `soup` of green leafy vegetables should be consumed. Then fruits and milk should be reintroduced. You should eventually return to your regular diet. Please note that this is a traditional approach to treating malaria. If you or someone you know is suffering from malaria, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for the most appropriate"

  utter_high_blood_pressue_question:
  - text: "**Blood pressure, what is it:**  \n In order to keep us alive, blood constantly reaches every part of our body through veins. This essential function is carried out continuously by our heart. It acts like a pump and pushes blood into arteries and vessels. The action of the heart to push blood into the veins is called 'blood pressure' or blood pressure. It is a completely natural physiological process without which we cannot survive.  \n **Blood pressure can rise naturally in the following conditions that cannot be stopped:**  \n (1) When there is a slight excitement and enthusiasm in temperament. (2) When there is any kind of slight nervousness or fear. (3) After eating. (4) When there is any kind of happiness, to the point that in extreme happiness, a person's blood pressure can rise and cause damage to their veins and blood vessels, leading to immediate death. | (5) When watching interesting scenes, smelling strong odors, or hearing loud or harsh sounds, (the secret of this is on tired soldiers). (6) During emotions such as anger, etc. (7) During sexual intercourse, (8) After a cold shower, (the effect of cold water tightens the body's blood vessels, which has two simultaneous effects. One is that it causes goosebumps on the body, and the other is that it increases blood pressure.) However, those who say 'we have high blood pressure' mean that their blood pressure is slightly higher and is stable or recurring. And what is actually a terrible disease. This condition is 100% unnatural, the consequences of which can be severe at any time. Those who have high blood pressure disease continue to put undue pressure on the heart, which weakens it. It is not a sudden disease but gradually becomes apparent. As long as the condition of the veins and blood vessels in the body is normal, i.e., as long as they remain elastic and their holes remain open, the heart does not need to exert excessive pressure to circulate the blood properly, and the blood naturally reaches every part of the body through veins and blood vessels. But when the holes of the veins and blood vessels contract for the following reasons, the heart has to exert excessive pressure to circulate the blood properly, and the heart has to exert an unnatural pressure to push the blood into the narrow veins and thin blood vessels of the body. For this, the heart has to work quite hard, which weakens it. This is called High Blood Pressure. High blood pressure disease, or in other words, losing the flexibility of blood vessels and the narrowing of their holes is only due to our artificial and irregular lifestyle. Those who are uncontrolled in their diet make the circulation of blood in their bodies distorted and unhealthy. Because disorders and poison in more quantity than necessary carry any waste in the body in the form of unnecessary weight, it gradually travels in the veins, arteries, and vessels of the body, slowly tightens the arteries, veins, and blood vessels and sticks to their holes. As a result, it contracts on the walls of the blood vessels and makes blood circulation tight, and tightens the path of blood circulation by sticking to their holes. As more waste will accumulate in the body, it will stick to the walls of the vessels, resulting in as much constriction of the blood vessels, so much more constriction of the blood vessels will cause blood circulation to become tight, and with the same proportion, this disease will be fast and slow.  \n **In summary, these are the causes of high blood pressure:**  \n1. To avoid things made from refined flour (like bread), sugar, spices, oil, sour foods, fried items, proteins, yogurt, cream, lentils, etc., as well as excessive consumption of coffee, tea, and cigarettes. 2. Avoid eating excessively or frequently. 3. Limit the intake of alcoholic beverages. 4. Lack of physical exercise. 5. Lack of self-discipline. 6. Suffering from mental disorders such as worry, anger, fear, etc. 7. Problems related to the urinary tract, kidney disorders, chronic indigestion, constipation, and a deficiency in brain function.  \n **Regarding blood pressure:**  \n To determine whether your blood pressure is high, low, or normal, it is advisable to use a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure measuring device). Before the invention of this device, doctors used to check the pulse in the wrist to estimate blood pressure, which was often inaccurate. A healthy 20-year-old typically has a systolic blood pressure around 120 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It is considered normal for blood pressure to be in the range of 120 to 130 mmHg. Anything above 130 mmHg should be considered high blood pressure, and if it falls below 120 mmHg, it might be considered low blood pressure. Extremely low blood pressure, below 110 mmHg, is known as hypotension. Blood pressure can vary in different parts of the body, depending on the distance from the heart. Therefore, the left arm's artery, situated in the upper part of the body, is chosen for accurate blood pressure measurements as it often has higher blood pressure due to its proximity to the heart. Blood pressure can differ throughout the body, and using a device to measure it is essential. Additionally, there are various symptoms associated with high blood pressure, such as dizziness, headaches, lack of concentration, insomnia, shortness of breath, digestive problems, irritability, weakness, occasional nosebleeds, chest pain, and difficulty in strenuous activities. If any of these symptoms are present in an individual, it is advisable to consider them as signs of elevated blood pressure. The primary medical approach for managing this condition is to prevent the risk factors associated with it and follow general health guidelines. It includes not drinking water during meals, drinking water at least two hours after meals, chewing food thoroughly, urinating after a meal, and taking short walks of at least 50 steps followed by a little rest, not sleeping immediately after eating, taking deep breaths suitable for one's strength in the morning and evening, and consuming lemon juice mixed with water in generous amounts throughout the day. Also, have your evening meal before sunset and avoid eating when not hungry. On some days, observe a fast by residing near water bodies and perform minimal activities during that time.  \n **Medication and blood pressure:**  \n Using medicines in the case of blood pressure issues can be harmful. It is best not to use any medication without proper guidance. Dr. I. Harris, a specialist in cardiology from Liverpool Heart Hospital, suggests that medication to control blood pressure is not only futile but can also have adverse effects. If possible, fasting for a few days can be beneficial. If fasting is not an option, sticking to a diet of raw and boiled vegetables for 5 to 10 days can be effective. If vegetables are part of the diet, it is beneficial to drink a glass of juice made from carrots, cucumbers, etc., in the morning, only consume salads for lunch, and eat only boiled vegetables in the evening. If fasting is chosen, consume fruit only during the day. Eat only one type of fruit at a time and have fruit-juice in the morning and evening. Garlic can be helpful in managing blood pressure. Dry and grind seeds of gooseberry, myrobalan, and beleric myrobalan and mix them with water, making a paste. Soak this paste in water overnight. Strain it in the morning and drink it. This will help lower elevated blood pressure. Please note that these are general guidelines and should not replace professional medical advice and treatment. If you have concerns about your blood pressure or health, consult a healthcare professional."

  utter_diabetes_question:
  - text: "Often, this disease occurs when the digestive system, especially the pancreas, does not function properly. This is a special disease for those who read and write, are lazy, and live for the pleasure of eating, which provides the body with a lot of comfort and requires very little effort. This disease is less common in laborers and women. It is mostly found in intelligent men above the age of forty. Constipation is the main cause of this disease. 90% of diabetes patients are either obese or have become obese. As the disease progresses, their weight also starts to decrease. It hardens the body's arteries, leading to a 66% fatality rate from this disease. Diabetes is also called Prameha, Polyuria, and passing sweet urine. Diabetes has two types. In one type, sugar is present in the urine, but in the other type, there is no sugar; only the urine is excessive.  \n(1) Diabetes without sugar - This is also called Polyuria and Diabetes Insipidus in English. In this disease, urine resembling water is passed in large quantities and frequently. This disease is generally due to overexertion. However, nervous weakness is the main cause of this disease. Therefore, this disease can occur suddenly due to any mental excitement. When the body's sweat glands become blocked for some reason, the liquid waste that is normally excreted from the body as sweat accumulates in the kidneys and is excreted as polyuria. Excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to cold, and excessive consumption of cold water can also cause this disease. In polyuria, approximately one gallon of urine is excreted from the body in 24 hours. To treat this disease, it is essential to first cleanse the stomach and relieve constipation. For at least a week, one should follow a liquid diet, and when necessary, take a warm or cold water enema. It is advisable to use a wet cloth around the waist at night. To stimulate the sweat glands, one should sit on a bare chair for five minutes, covered with a blanket, and take a steam bath, or sunbathe. After that, take a natural shower with cold water for 10 minutes or a regular shower with cold water. Once a week, wrap the entire body in a wet cloth for an hour, then take a cold shower. Daily light exercise or fresh air in an open space is also necessary. Consume alkaline foods such as fruits, fresh vegetables, and fresh milk. Drink a mixture of paper and lemon juice in abundance. Initially, drink warm water for a few days and then cold water. Keep the body warm by wearing warm clothing.  \n(2) **Diabetes with sugar -**  \n This type of diabetes is called `Madhumeha` in English. It occurs due to impaired digestion and is very difficult to treat. Along with this disease, there are many other ailments, including weak digestion, excessive hunger, excessive thirst, constipation, headaches, dizziness, eye problems, dry skin, weakness, muscle cramps, dental problems, foul odor from the mouth, and more. As the disease progresses and becomes chronic, it leads to more severe physical disorders, such as itching all over the body, poorly healing sores, carbuncles, blocked sweat glands, lung problems, tuberculosis, nerve disorders, blindness, urinary tract irritation, impotence, and eczema. The urine of patients with this disease is clear, light, and foamy, and nothing settles at the bottom when stored in a bottle. However, it contains a sweet or sour taste. The patient urinates 2-5 kilograms during the day and night, with up to 50 grams of sugar in it. Due to mental disorders such as anxiety, anger, and fear, the symptoms above the disease increase abnormally. This disease gradually becomes more severe. The weight decreases, the body dries up, weakness increases, and the body temperature rises. In this disease, the spleen and liver cannot perform their functions completely, and the pancreas does not produce digestive juice in the required amount from the glands, such as the pancreas, etc. As a result, food is not digested properly, and when it is converted into sugar in the spleen and brought into the blood for the body's use, an excess of sugar remains in the blood due to the looseness of the spleen. This sugar is forced to come out with urine through the kidneys' urinary path, along with other liquid toxins in the body. When sugar comes out with urine in this way, it is called diabetes. Here it should be understood that what we eat goes into the stomach and first takes the form of sugar, which the body extracts after assimilation, giving it strength and warmth. However, when this sugar goes out with urine without being used by the body, the body gradually weakens day by day and eventually gets destroyed. Most obese people are affected by this disease, and 20% of diabetics have this hereditary disease.  \n **Medical treatment -**  \n In the beginning, if the patient is not very weak, they should do a two or three-day fast with an enema. Then, after breaking the fast, for ten days, one should completely give up all food and only consume boiled green leafy vegetables or their soup (juice) along with oranges, tomatoes, muskmelons, pineapples, grapes, mangoes, jamuns, guavas, pears, apples, ripe gular, etc., and the sugar will be reduced in the urine, and at the same time, the energy within the body will be awakened. It absorbs the sugar into the body and prevents it from coming out without use. After that, for a month, you should drink fresh fruit juice or a 10-gram juice as a breakfast, followed by a meal of barley or wheat porridge and boiled vegetables at lunch, a glass of butter milk in the afternoon, and only a glass of fruit juice in the evening. Normal bathing should be done with cold water. If weakness is too much, this bath can also be done with lukewarm water for a few days. However, while bathing, one should leave a cold water stream on the spine for 5 minutes after defecation in the morning. Then take a bath and rub the body with the palms of the hands. Continuous treatment with the above course of treatment completely eliminates diabetes. And if the disease increases and does not go away, then the same course of treatment should be repeated to completely eradicate the disease. If there are no ants in the urine, then understand that there is no sugar in it. If the patient wants to recover quickly, the following practices should be added to the above treatment course.  \n(1) After the morning toilet, take an enema with fresh water. After that, apply a wet mud plaster on the stomach for half an hour, or take a katishnan (spinal bath) for 20 minutes. Then, exercise with strength or brisk walking in fresh air or just perform deep breathing exercises. This will relieve constipation.  \n(2) Bathe in the morning or take a mild bath in the afternoon. After that, do some exercises with strength. This will increase physical energy.  \n(3) By applying a wet cloth on the abdomen or massaging it, apply a wet cloth to the back for the night.  \n(4) Mix one part of sun-heated water in a bottle of orange color, and mix one part of sky-blue color in 50-50 grams of 4 doses daily. With this modified course of treatment, sugar in the urine will stop within only 15 days. In addition to the above, physical and mental rest is essential in this disease. Staying in open air and practicing deep breathing exercises are necessary, and drinking lemon juice squeezed into water several times a day is also beneficial. Chewing 4 grams of jambul seed powder or just chewing four green leaves of jambul twice a day is helpful. And fasting and molasses are effective in eliminating diabetes. In this disease, drinking 8 glasses of water within 24 hours also speeds up the recovery. Diet - Avoid bitter gourd, pointed gourd, tomatoes, jambul, cucumbers, cucumbers, papayas, chana soaked in milk with honey, roti made from barley and equal parts of chana flour, spinach, bathua, chaulai, lauki, nenwa, phalsa, khinni, curd, watermelon, ripe mango, papaya, pomegranate, guava, radish, patagobi, mattha, chapati made from whole wheat flour, jowar, savaan, raagi, sprouted moong, chana, etc. Avoid - Avoid potatoes, rice, peas, carrots, cashews, almonds, walnuts, white food, all kinds of sweet fruits, dates, raisins, figs, munakka, khumani, shaljam, oil, spices, sugar, sweets, jaggery, meat-fish, eggs, tea, coffee, tobacco, etc.  \n **Restriction -**  \n Excessive consumption of intoxicants, more food, more than 6-7 hours of sleep, constipation, delusion, anger, fear, etc., mental disorders. Milk and butter, etc."
